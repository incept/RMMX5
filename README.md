# RMMX5 — Crisis Management CRM

Next.js 16 (App Router) + Supabase CRM for crisis/reputation management:
a spreadsheet-fast contact grid with colored statuses, per-contact link
tracking (14 slots) with a **Reputation Score** (ported from the ContextAI /
Reputation Monitor scoring engine), Monday.com import, unified inbox with
multi-account SMTP, email sequences with start/stop triggers, SMS campaigns,
voicemail drops, vendor management, revenue projection, and a full admin panel.

## 1. Set up Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL Editor, run every file in `supabase/migrations/` in numeric order,
   currently `0001_init.sql` through `0008_audit_remediation.sql`. Together they
   create every table, the storage buckets, seed data, RLS, SMTP ownership
   controls, atomic sequence claiming, and notification/webhook deduplication.
3. Copy the Project URL and API keys into `.env.local` (start from
   `.env.local.example`). Mind the key types: the **publishable** key
   (`sb_publishable_…`, or legacy `anon`) goes in
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; the **secret** key (`sb_secret_…`, or
   legacy `service_role`) goes in `SB_SECRET_KEY` only. Putting a
   secret key in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` var makes every page fail with
   *"Forbidden use of secret API key in browser"*. After editing
   `.env.local`, restart `npm run dev` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked in
   at build time.
4. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users, create the initial account.
   The database deliberately creates every new Auth identity as a **disabled
   worker**. In the SQL Editor, bootstrap that one trusted account:

   ```sql
   update public.profiles
   set role = 'admin', status = 'active'
   where email = 'owner@your-company.example';
   ```

   Sign in with that account, then create all later users under Admin → Users.
   Keep public Supabase signups disabled; even if they are accidentally enabled,
   the database will not activate or promote those identities.

## 2. Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000, sign in with the bootstrapped admin, then visit
**Admin → Integrations** to enter your BrightData / Emailit / TextLink / Stripe
keys (they live in the `settings` table with admin-only RLS — not in env vars).

## 3. The cron tick

Sequences and countdown notifications are driven by one idempotent endpoint.
Schedule it every 5–15 minutes (Vercel Cron, hPanel cron, GitHub Actions…):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  "https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/tick"
```

`CRON_SECRET` comes from `.env.local`.

## 4. Webhooks

Webhook credentials are never placed in URLs:

| Purpose | URL | Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fluent Forms lead capture | `POST /api/webhooks/fluent-forms` | `Authorization: Bearer <Fluent Forms secret>` |
| Inbound email → inbox/reply detection | `POST /api/webhooks/inbound-email` | `Authorization: Bearer <inbound-email secret>` |
| Emailit bounce/complaint events | `POST /api/webhooks/emailit` | Emailit's `X-Emailit-Signature` + `X-Emailit-Timestamp` |
| CallScaler post-call events | `POST /api/webhooks/callscaler` | `X-RMMX-Webhook-Secret: <CallScaler secret>` |

Configure separate values under Admin → Integrations. Every provider delivery
must carry its stable event/message/submission ID (or
`X-RMMX-Idempotency-Key`); requests without one are rejected so retries cannot
create duplicate contacts or messages. Copy Emailit's `whsec_…` signing secret
into the Emailit section. Provider event IDs are deduplicated across retries.

The Fluent Forms feed should send the form fields (name/email/phone/city/
state) plus tracking fields (ip, browser/user_agent, utm_source, utm_term…).
On arrival the app creates the contact, runs the BrightData Google search for
the lead's name, keeps results whose domain matches a **relevant** URL rule,
fills link slots 1–14, and computes the Reputation Score.

## 5. How scoring works

- Every **live** link is matched against Admin → URL Rules by exact hostname
  (including subdomains) and optional path prefix. Matched links contribute the
  rule's `score_weight`; unmatched
  live links contribute 10. Negative-sentiment titles/snippets add +5
  (lexicon ported from ContextAI).
- `reputation_score = clamp(100 − link_score, 0, 100)` — removals raise it.
- `revenue_projection = Σ removal_price` of matched live links.
- Rules also carry `difficulty` (1–10, shown as D-badges) and an optional
  vendor.

## 6. Email delivery notes

- Outbound mail prefers the selected/default **SMTP account** (nodemailer);
  with none configured it falls back to the **Emailit API** key.
- Every outbound email gets an open-tracking pixel and click-tracked links
  (`/api/track/open`, `/api/track/click`) and is logged to the unified inbox.
- Reply detection relies on the inbound-email webhook (point Emailit inbound
  routing or any forwarder at it). True IMAP polling is intentionally out of
  scope.

## 7. What's stubbed / worth hardening

- **Voicemail drops** POST to a configurable provider endpoint — wire it to
  your ringless-VM vendor's real API shape.
- **TextLink** requires a paired Android device with an active SIM (see their
  docs); if the device is offline, sends fail.
- **Rate limiting** is not implemented on general authenticated API routes;
  deploy behind a platform/WAF request limit. Upload endpoints do enforce file
  size and active-content restrictions.
- **Password reset** flow isn't wired into a page (Supabase supports it).
- `xlsx` (SheetJS 0.20.3 via the official CDN tarball) parses admin-uploaded
  files only.
